# pointer could have been set using secp256k1_context_set_illegal_callback or

# With ECDSA a third-party can forge a second distinct signature of the same
# message, given a single initial signature, but without knowing the key. This
# is done by negating the S value modulo the order of the curve, 'flipping'
# the sign of the random point R which is not included in the signature.
#
# Forgery of the same message isn't universally problematic, but in systems
# where message malleability or uniqueness of signatures is important this can
# cause issues. This forgery can be blocked by all verifiers forcing signers
# to use a normalized form.
#
# The lower-S form reduces the size of signatures slightly on average when
# variable length encodings (such as DER) are used and is cheap to verify,
# making it a good choice. Security of always using lower-S is assured because
# anyone can trivially modify a signature after the fact to enforce this
# property anyway.
#
# The lower S value is always between 0x1 and
# 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0,

#
# No other forms of ECDSA malleability are known and none seem likely, but
# there is no formal proof that ECDSA, even with this additional restriction,
# is free of other malleability. Commonly used serialization schemes will also
# accept various non-unique encodings, so care should be taken when this
# property is required for an application.
#
# The secp256k1_ecdsa_sign function will by default create signatures in the
